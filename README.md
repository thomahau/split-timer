# Split timer

React stopwatch timer with split functionality. Clicking a split in the list will remove all splits after it, and reset the timer to that split. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and styled with Sass.

## Getting started

Clone the repository and `npm install` the dependencies. `npm test` will run the component tests. `npm start` will launch the application.
